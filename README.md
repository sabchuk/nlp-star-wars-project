<p>This project is a brief analysis of Star Wars Episodes II-VI scripts. In this analysis, the VADER library (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) was used to classify the feelings behind each line of dialogue in the films.</p>
<p>The data used can be found in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kunyuhe/star-wars-movie-dialogues-segmented-by-scene).</p>
<p>Exploratory analysis techniques and the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries were used to generate graphs. The objective of the analysis is to determine which of the analyzed episodes is the most "dark" of the trilogy, as well as to analyze the evolution of the character Darth Vader throughout the analyzed episodes.</p>
